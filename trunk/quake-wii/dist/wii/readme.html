		<h1>QuakeGX - 2008/06/13</h1>
		
		<h2>Requirements</h2>

		<ul>
			<li>A Wii.</li>
			<li>Twilight Hack, The Homebrew Channel or some other way of running programs from SD Card.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Release Notes for version 0.01</h2>

		<ul>
			<li>To correctly see the transparent water without artifacts, please apply <a href=http://vispatch.sourceforge.net/>Vispatch</a> to your pak0.pak (and pak1.pak, if you have the full version) file.</li>
			<li>Be sure to read the "Installation" section for info regarding the different Wiimote button mappings.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>Installation</h2>
		
		<ol>
			<li>Note: If you have a version released before 13th June 2008 installed, remove ID1/CONFIG.CFG from your SD Card. This is necessary because the button naming for the Wiimote has changed, and deleting ID1/CONFIG.CFG will make the new defaults with the new button names be used.</li>
			<li>Copy the ID1 folder to the root of your SD Card.</li>
			<li>Copy Quake's PAK0.PAK (and PAK1.PAK if you own the full version) into the ID1 folder on your SD Card.</li>
			<li>Insert the SD Card into the Wii front SD slot.</li>
			<li>Launch QuakeGX.dol using your method of choice.</li>
		</ol>
		
		<h2>Credits</h2>

		<ul>
			<li>Original game by <a href="http://www.idsoftware.com/">id Software</a>.</li>
			<li>GameCube conversion by <a href="http://aaiiee.wordpress.com/">Peter Mackay</a>.</li>
			<li>GameCube version testing by eke, org and plootid.</li>
			<li>Wii version and GX graphics acceleration by Eluan Miranda</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>General notes</h2>

		<ul>
			<li>You can freely change button bindings on the Wiimote without affecting the GC pad bindings, except for the D-Pad on both controllers and Start/Plus. These are paired and changing one's binding will change the other</li>
			<li>There is still no music support, but expect it for future releases. (Probably you will have to rip your original quake music from your CD.)</li>
			<li>There is a new menu option for adjusting the size of the screen to adjust for your TV's overscan. (Does not work with the GX accelerated version yet.)</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Software rendering notes</h2>

		<ul>
			<li>All of the original dosquake rendering features are supported.</li>
			<li>Unfortunately, the original palette is converted from RGB8 to RGB565. The best way to correct this is writing a full 24-bit software renderer, but don't expect it soon.</li>
			<li>Framerate may be a bit choppy and there is still no support for going back to the old 320x200 resolution.</li>
			<li>Software rendering is only available through svn.
		</ul>

		<h2>Hardware rendering notes</h2>

		<ul>
			<li>Full speed, fully implemented GX port of the original glquake, with some new features being added gradually.</li>
			<li>Supports all of the original glquake features: dynamic lightmaps, water transparency, and more.</li>
			<li>To make the water correctly transparent, you will need water-vised maps. Please do not use r_novis 1. It wasn't meant to be this way, r_novis 1 disables all visibility testing and draws the entire map every frame.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Default controls</h2>

		<ul>
			<li>Gamecube PAD</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Attack:			R</li>
				<li>Jump:			A</li>
				<li>Run/Walk:			L</li>
				<li>Previous Weapon:		D-Pad Left or Y</li>
				<li>Next Weapon:		D-Pad Right or X</li>
				<li>Swim Up:			D-Pad Up</li>
				<li>Swim Down:			D-Pad Down</li>
				<li>Show Scores:		Z</li>
				<li>Pause/Menu:			Start/Pause</li>
				<li>Select (in menu):		A</li>
				<li>Back (in menu):		B</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Wiimote</li>

				<li>Attack:			B</li>
				<li>Jump:			A</li>
				<li>Run/Walk:			C</li>
				<li>Previous Weapon:		D-Pad Left</li>
				<li>Next Weapon:		D-Pad Right</li>

			<li>If "Previous Weapon" doesn't work, probably you're using Quake's version 1.01 PAK0.PAK, you should really upgrade to version 1.06's PAK0.PAK. It is available at this project's page as the shareware version. (Will work for the full version too.)</li>
