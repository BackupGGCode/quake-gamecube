UPDATE 2012/07/03: Since this project is now more or less feature-complete in relation to the original id Software GLQUAKE, it has been on idle for a while. But there are still many novel things to be done and I'm accepting patches begining now.

There were already some patches that were sent to me, but I've lost them among other things, my life was very turbulent for a while, but now everything is settled again. (If you sent me a patch during this time, may you know that I'M SORRY!)

Also, if you have experience with the Quake engine and want to help clear the list of issues here on googlecode, I will HAPPILY give you access to the repository. Who knows when I will be able to really dig into this code again.

By the way, google wasn't sending me updates on the issues list either.

Based on the original GameCube port by Peter Mackay.
