= Installing the game on your SD card =

 # Download the game and copy it onto your SD card. Your SD card should have the following layout, where "/" is the root of the card:
  * `/ID1/PAK0.PAK`
  * `/ID1/PAK1.PAK` (if you own the full version of Quake)
  * `/ID1/WII.PAK` (Wii version only)
  * `/ID1/CONFIG.CFG` (!GameCube version only)
  * `/SDLOAD.DOL` (only if you use SD Media Launcher and the !GameCube version)
 # For the !GameCube version, please ensure that the `ID1` folder and `PAK*.PAK` files are in the correct locations and are named only in UPPER CASE. The SD card library which quake-gamecube uses to read the data files requires that the file names are in upper case _only_. The Wii version doesn't have his problem. SD Media Launcher for !GameCube should have the Quake.dol somewhere inside the SD Card.
 # For the Wii version, the QuakeGX.dol file need to be installed accordingly to your boot method. Consult your launch method documentation for specifics.
